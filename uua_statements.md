        <h3 class="text-center">Side With Love Statement on the Killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis</h3>
        <p>January 8, 2026</p>
        <p>We grieve the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37 year-old mother and legal observer,  by Immigration and Customs 
            Enforcement in Minneapolis yesterday—an act of state violence that has stolen a life and reverberates through an 
            already-wounded community. </p>
        <p>We invite all people of faith and conscience to grieve together, to refuse the normalization of state violence, 
            and to commit themselves to the long work of transforming the systems that betray our deepest moral and spiritual 
            commitments.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Unitarian Universalist Association Condemns Military Strikes Against Venezuela</h3>
        <p>January 3, 2026</p>
        <p>The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) condemns the Trump Administration’s military strikes overnight against 
        the country of Venezuela, done with the express purpose of capturing its president, Nicolás Maduro, and seizing control 
        of the country in violation of international laws. These actions were taken after months of U.S. military harassment 
        resulting in the deaths of Venezuelan civilians and undertaken without involvement of Congress, according to published 
        reports. As people of faith and conscience, it is essential to speak out now as this situation quickly escalates, creating 
        dangers across the Hemisphere.</p>
