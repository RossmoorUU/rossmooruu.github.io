# About Unitarian Universalism

Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a liberal faith that emphasizes the inherent worth and dignity of every person, regardless of their background or beliefs. It is rooted in the principles of reason, individual freedom, and social responsibility. UUs believe that all people are connected and that our lives are intertwined with those around us. This perspective fosters a sense of community, compassion, and inclusivity, as UUs strive to create a more just and equitable society for all.

Unitarian Universalism draws on a wide range of spiritual traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and others, but rejects dogmatic or creedal forms of faith. Instead, UUs focus on the development of their own unique values and practices, such as meditation, prayer, and community service. The faith also places great emphasis on intellectual exploration, critical thinking, and personal growth, encouraging its members to question, seek answers, and cultivate wisdom in all aspects of life. By embracing diversity, promoting tolerance, and advocating for social justice, Unitarian Universalism seeks to create a world that is more just, compassionate, and equitable for everyone.
