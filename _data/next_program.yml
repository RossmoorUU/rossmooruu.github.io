- title: "To What End?"
  date: Friday, July 11, 2025
  description: Rev. Christie Hardwick’s latest book, “To What End?”, is an inquiry into the reasons we live our lives 
    and contribute to the “whole”. Her philosophy is, “We are all made of the same stuff. What each of us thinks, says, 
    and does matters to the whole”.<br>
    For July’s program, Rev. Hardwick will lead a vibrant interactive discussion examining the defining moments in our 
    lives. How did what we thought was our ‘end game’ change from our first decade to the most recent one? What meaning 
    do we make of our role now? She will share her personal journey, which moved through phases of material and worldly 
    success to inner balance and peace.
