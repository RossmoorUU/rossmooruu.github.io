  description: "Drawing upon his latest book (The Scandal of Cal: Land Grabs, White Supremacy, and 
    Miseducation at UC Berkeley, Heyday 2023), Platt will discuss how and why universities 
    (such as Berkeley) create fantasy narratives about their past and promote amnesia about their 
    actual history; and what can be done to break institutional silence and do justice to history."
  speaker: Tony Platt
