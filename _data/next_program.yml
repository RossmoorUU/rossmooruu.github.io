- title: Multiple Choice Holiday Celebration
  date: Friday, December 12, 2025
  description: Join us for our annual holiday brown bag on December 12th, where we embrace the spirit of multiple winter 
    celebrations or simply a festive gathering. Come to sing, share stories, enjoy delightful cookies, and spread cheer. 
    As always, we'll meet at the Vista Room in the Hillside Complex, at our regular time (11:15 a.m.) on the second Friday of 
    the month. Let's partake in joyous merriment together!
