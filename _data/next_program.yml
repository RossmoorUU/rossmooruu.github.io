- title: Exploring What Matters Most
  subtitle: A Conversation About Values
  date: Friday August 8th, 2025
  description: Join us for a thought-provoking and engaging discussion as we delve into the core of what guides our lives. 
    In our upcoming meeting, we'll be exploring the concept of values – both the principles that shape the Unitarian 
    Universalist faith and the personal values that define each of us. We'll begin by examining real-life scenarios that 
    present us with choices, prompting us to consider how our values inform our decisions.<br><br>
    The meeting will be structured around small group conversations, offering a safe and supportive space to share your 
    perspectives, listen to others, and gain new insights. This isn't about finding "right" answers, but about fostering 
    deeper self-awareness and understanding how we can live more intentionally aligned with what truly matters. Come 
    prepared to share, listen, and connect with fellow members in a meaningful exploration of our shared and individual 
    values. We believe this will be a valuable opportunity for personal reflection and community building.
