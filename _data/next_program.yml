    Elder abuse is a significant and often hidden problem in America, affecting roughly 1 in 10 older adults annually. This 
    abuse – including physical, emotional, sexual, financial, neglect, and abandonment – frequently occurs at the hands of 
    trusted individuals like family members or caregivers. Driven by factors such as caregiver stress and elder vulnerability, 
    it has devastating consequences. Tragically, many cases go unreported due to fear, shame, and the elder's dependence on 
    the abuser, making it difficult to fully understand the extent of the problem and provide needed support.
