- title: "Exploring what matters most"
  date: Friday, August 8, 2025
  description: At our August meeting, we explored the concept of values – both the principles that shape the Unitarian Universalist 
    faith and the personal values that define each of us. We began by making choices, prompting us to consider how our values 
    inform our decisions. <br> The meeting was led by Peggy Wilcox, who guided us through a 
    series of small group conversations, creating a safe and supportive space for sharing perspectives, listening to others, 
    and gaining new insights. This wasn't about finding "right" answers, but rather fostering deeper self-awareness. <br>
    The meeting was attended by numerous members who shared their thoughts, listened to one another, and connected on a 
    meaningful level through the exploration of our shared and individual values. We believe this experience provided valuable 
    opportunities for personal reflection and community building.
