- title: "Elder Abuse Prevention"
  date: Friday, October 10, 2025
  description: In October, we had the opportunity to learn from a knowledgeable expert as Matthew Hulse discussed 
    the vital mission and critical work of Contra Costa Senior Legal Services (CCSLS). He shed light on the 
    organization's efforts to combat elder abuse in our community.<br><br>Elder abuse is a significant and often 
    hidden problem in America, affecting roughly 1 in 10 older adults annually. This abuse – including physical, 
    emotional, sexual, financial, neglect, and abandonment – frequently occurs at the hands of trusted individuals 
    like family members or caregivers. Driven by factors such as caregiver stress and elder vulnerability, it has 
    devastating consequences. Tragically, many cases go unreported due to fear, shame, and the elder's dependence 
    on the abuser, making it difficult to fully understand the extent of the problem and provide needed support.
