  author: Tony Platt
  description: The University of California, Berkeley—widely known as "Cal"—is admired worldwide as a 
    bastion of innovation and a hub for progressive thought. Far less known are the university’s roots

    university’s desecration of graves and large-scale hoarding of Indigenous remains.
