  description: Breath and Spirit half-day spiritual retreat will focus on cultivating the resources of inner peace. 
    Understanding how we can bring resources to our own hearts is a vital way we can stay tenacious, persistent and engaged.

    we have within our own hearts and which can be a lifeline in these times of uncertainty and change.
