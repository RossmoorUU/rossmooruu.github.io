                <h2>Interfaith Harmony and Identity</h2>
                <p>In a thought-provoking and interactive presentation, Rose explored the challenges and opportunities of navigating multiple religious beliefs and identities within a single community or individual in the past. How could one building or person have created a welcoming environment for diverse spiritual practices during that time? Can individuals who held multiple identities that may seem at odds with each other have existed? </p><p> Rose's past presentation delved into the complexities of interfaith harmony, questioning whether someone could have been both a Christian and a Buddhist, an atheist and a Muslim, or any other combination. She encouraged attendees to share their own reflections on these questions.</p>
